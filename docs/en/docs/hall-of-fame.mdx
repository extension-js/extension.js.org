# Extension.js Hall of Fame

Extension.js is an open-source project that has been made possible by the contributions of many individuals.

Browser extensions are a powerful tool for extending the functionality of web browsers. They allow developers to create custom features, enhance existing functionality, and improve the user experience. The experience of developing browser extensions in the other hand can be challenging, especially when working with multiple browsers. Thanks to these individuals, Extension.js has made it easier to develop cross-browser extensions.
