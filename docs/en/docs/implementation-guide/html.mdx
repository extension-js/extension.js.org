# HTML

Build extension UIs with plain HTML entrypoints while Extension.js handles asset wiring, script/style bundling, and dev-time update behavior.

Extension.js processes HTML entrypoints from manifest fields and from the special `pages/` folder.

## HTML capabilities

| Capability           | What it gives you                                            |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Entrypoint discovery | Compile HTML declared in manifest and `pages/` with one flow |
| Asset wiring         | Bundle referenced scripts and styles from HTML tags          |
| Public path handling | Keep intentional public-root assets stable                   |
| Dev tracking         | Recompile on HTML and referenced asset edits                 |

## Supported HTML entrypoints

The following manifest fields use HTML files as entrypoints:

| Manifest field                     | File type expected |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| `action.default_popup`             | `.html`            |
| `background.page`                  | `.html`            |
| `chrome_url_overrides.*`           | `.html`            |
| `devtools_page`                    | `.html`            |
| `options_ui.page` / `options_page` | `.html`            |
| `page_action.default_popup`        | `.html`            |
| `sandbox.pages`                    | `.html`            |
| `side_panel.default_path`          | `.html`            |
| `sidebar_action.default_panel`     | `.html`            |

You can also add standalone pages under `pages/` without expanding manifest entrypoint fields for every file.

## Sample HTML entry

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>My Extension Page</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./styles.css" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="app"></div>
    <script src="./main.ts"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

## How Extension.js processes HTML

For each HTML entrypoint, Extension.js:

1. emits the HTML file into compilation
2. discovers local scripts/styles/static assets from tags
3. bundles scripts/styles as proper extension outputs
4. patches HTML to inject compiled bundle references
5. keeps public-root references (like `/icon.png`) as public assets

{/* VIDEO_PLACEHOLDER: Show an HTML entrypoint importing a script and stylesheet, then inspect emitted compiled HTML and bundled assets. */}

## Development behavior

- HTML and referenced assets are tracked in file dependencies, so edits trigger recompilation.
- Script changes use HMR where supported in the injected script flow.
- If the HTML script/style entry list changes (add/remove entries), Extension.js can require a dev server restart.
- Manifest HTML entrypoint changes can also trigger restart-required diagnostics.

## Paths and environment variables

- Relative paths are resolved from the HTML file location.
- Leading `/` paths are treated as extension public-root paths.
- `$EXTENSION_PUBLIC_*` and related placeholders can be replaced in emitted HTML during compilation.

## Using extra pages

Place extra files in `pages/`:

```plaintext
pages/
└── extra-page.html
```

## Best practices

- Keep entry HTML minimal and import app code through scripts.
- Use relative paths for project assets and `/` paths only for intentional public assets.
- Use `pages/` for additional extension pages that are not primary manifest UI entrypoints.
- Treat script/link add/remove changes as structural changes that may require restart.
