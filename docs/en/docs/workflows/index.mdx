# Extension development workflows

Keep extension releases stable by combining debugging, security, performance, testing, and CI workflows.

## Workflow chooser

| Goal                                   | Read this
| -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------
| Diagnose local failures quickly        | [Troubleshooting](./troubleshooting.mdx)
| Understand dev reload outcomes         | [Dev update behavior](./dev-update-behavior.mdx)
| Lock down extension safety checks      | [Security checklist](./security-checklist.mdx)
| Reduce runtime and startup regressions | [Performance playbook](./performance-playbook.mdx)
| Add end-to-end confidence checks       | [Playwright E2E](./playwright-e2e.mdx)
| Set up CI templates                    | [CI templates](./ci-templates.mdx)
| Apply cross-command controls           | [Global flags](./global-flags.mdx)

## Release confidence loop

1. Run targeted local checks (`dev` + troubleshooting).
2. Build production artifacts (`build` / `start`).
3. Validate critical flows with E2E and smoke checks.
4. Run CI templates before store submission.

## Next steps

- Use [Commands reference](../commands/index.mdx) to pick the right command per phase.
- Keep defaults centralized with [Extension config](../features/extension-configuration.mdx).
