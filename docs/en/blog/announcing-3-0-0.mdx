# Announcing Extension.js 3.0.0

> February 18, 2026

Extension.js 3.0.0 is now available.

This release is focused on one thing: helping teams ship production browser extensions with less setup, clearer workflows, and better defaults across Chrome, Edge, and Firefox.

## What ships in v3

**Version 3.0.0**

- Stronger cross-browser workflows across Chrome, Edge, and Firefox with one command surface.
- Expanded template experience for modern stacks including TypeScript, React, Vue, Svelte, and Preact.
- Improved development update behavior with clearer HMR, hard-reload, and restart-required boundaries.
- Better production confidence workflows across troubleshooting, security checks, performance checks, CI templates, and Playwright E2E.
- More predictable project configuration through `extension.config.js` and browser-aware build output.
- A cleaner documentation and homepage experience designed for faster onboarding and lower cognitive load.

## The day-one flow is simpler

Use one path from project creation to production output:

1. `create` to scaffold.
2. `dev` to iterate quickly.
3. `build` to generate production artifacts.
4. `start` or `preview` to validate production behavior.

```bash
npx extension@latest create my-extension --template=new-typescript
cd my-extension
pnpm dev
pnpm build
```

## Better for teams, not just demos

v3 is designed for real teams maintaining real extension codebases:

- Typed templates and framework-first baselines reduce setup drift.
- Browser-targeted builds and flags make compatibility checks explicit.
- Workflow docs now map directly to release confidence tasks.
- Security and performance guidance is integrated into standard delivery flow.

## Who this release is for

- Teams migrating from custom extension build scripts.
- Web developers moving from app development to extension development.
- Teams standardizing extension DX across multiple repos and contributors.

## Upgrade notes

If you are already using Extension.js:

- update the package to latest,
- prefer canonical template slugs (`new-react`, `new-typescript`, `new-vue`, etc.),
- keep your command flow aligned with `create` -> `dev` -> `build`.

## Thanks

Thanks to everyone building with Extension.js, reporting issues, and improving docs and templates with feedback.

v3 is a major step forward, and we are just getting started.
